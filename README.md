Sales Data Analysis Using NumPy Array Operations
Problem Statement
In today’s data-driven business environment, organizations rely on data analysis to understand sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue trends.
Students are required to analyze a real-world Supermarket Sales dataset using the NumPy library to perform numerical and statistical analysis.
The objective of this project is to apply NumPy array operations, indexing and slicing, mathematical and statistical functions, broadcasting, and vectorized computation to extract meaningful insights from sales data.

Project Objectives
Students should be able to:
1.	Load a real-world sales dataset and convert relevant data into NumPy arrays
2.	Perform array operations to calculate total and average sales
3.	Use indexing and slicing to extract specific sales records
4.	Apply statistical operations such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation
5.	Use broadcasting to calculate revenue from quantity and unit price
6.	Implement vectorized computation for efficient data analysis
7.	Interpret the statistical results to understand sales trends and performance
